# DMoney-API-Testing-By-Postman-With-NewmanReport

## Prerequisite
- NodeJs

## About this project:
D-Money API is a fintech API demo that enables users to transfer fake money from one user to another. I have claimed multiple APIs and created a collection of API responses (in both positive and negative scenarios) using Postman. Additionally, I have generated a report using Newman.
